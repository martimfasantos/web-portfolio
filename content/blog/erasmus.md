Living in Munich for six months was an incredible cultural journey. From enjoying the local Bavarian cuisine to exploring the city's history and the distinct and unique Munich culture, each day was unfolded as a new adventure, deepening my immersion in the local culture.

## Personal Growth and Global Perspective

The Erasmus+ program was not only about the academics and the city; it was also about the meaningful connections I made with students and colleagues from diverse backgrounds. The experience expanded my global perspective in ways I never anticipated. These connections expanded my global perspective in ways I never anticipated.
