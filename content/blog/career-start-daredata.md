A few months ago, I took an important step in my career by joining **DareData** as a **Data Scientist**.

Even though I had done a short internship before, this is my first longer-term professional role â€” a place where I can really grow, contribute, and start shaping the direction of my career. The first months were exciting and challenging at the same time, but above all, they gave me the chance to learn, get hands-on experience, and see how things work in a real professional AI setting.

## My first project @ NOS Portugal

I started working on a project with **NOS Portugal**, one of the countryâ€™s leading telecommunications and media companies. In my role as a GenAI Engineer, Iâ€™ve been able to put into practice some of the knowledge I gained during my Masterâ€™s degree and MSc thesis, while helping the team develop agents and tools to make processes more efficient.

Along the way, Iâ€™ve been learning, exploring AI agents and experimenting with a variety of frameworks and tools, including OpenAI, LlamaIndex, LangChain, Google A2A Protocol, Model Context Protocol (MCP), and much more. Itâ€™s been an amazing opportunity to learn how to design, build, and deploy agentic AI solutions in real-world contexts.

To share some of my findings and help others getting started with agentic AI, I've decided to create a repository that brings these frameworks together and compares their features for different project contexts ([AI Agents Frameworks Repo](https://github.com/martimfasantos/ai-agents-frameworks)). It contains foundational code for learning, experimenting, and testing a variety of state-of-the-art open-source AI agents frameworks.

## Life at DareData ðŸŒ±

Beyond the technical side, what really made these first months special was the **spirit and environment at DareData**. From day one, I felt welcomed and supported, encouraged to share knowledge, ask questions, and learn from colleagues who are super talented and approachable. The culture here is a perfect balance between professionalism and a relaxed atmosphere, which makes it a pleasure to work every day. 

I really recommend DareData to anyone looking to start or grow their career in Data and AI :)

## Looking ahead  

As I said before, these first months at DareData have been an amazing step in my **career in Data Science and AI**. Iâ€™ve learned so much in such a short time, both technically and personally, and I feel energized to keep moving forward.  

Iâ€™m excited to keep developing my skills, tackle new challenges, and contribute to meaningful projects with my amazing colleagues.
